    School Library Journal Review

    Gr 5-9-- Beginning with the 1951 ticker tape parade in New York City, Finkelstein introduces readers to MacArthur. The first chapter quickly reverts to early history of the MacArthur family. The remainder of the volume is devoted to a brief story of the general's life. The writing style is smooth and fluid. Because of the reading level, the content is limited to the high points of his life with very little depth or detail. There is not very much background information. The black-and-white photos are well placed, and the brief captions add to the text. This is by no means a definitive work, but it can be a valuable addition to the collection when material is needed for younger biography readers. --Eldon Younce, Harper Elementary School, Kans.
