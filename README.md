Play the game here: http://johnfkraus.com/15puzzle/index.html

To play the game on your local machine, download or clone the project and open the index.html file in your browser.  That's all.

To do:
1.  Update the code to modern JavaScript.  I wrote most of this years ago.
2.  Implement a responsive framework so it works well as a mobile application.  Note, however, that it works on mobile devices as-is but you have to zoom in to the game board.
